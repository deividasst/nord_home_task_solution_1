# Additional information about project architecture

We are using helper classes in the project. Helpers are saved in /helpers/ folder and imported in codecept.conf.js files.

It is mandatory not to invoke other helpers in a helper file.

- Example => const apiHelper = require('../../../helpers/apiHelper'),
  should not be invoked in any of the helpers without rechecking that it doesnt break any of existing tests.

If a new helper file is created and if there is a demand to see function reference created by clicking on it (CTRIL + left click),
then a command needs to be run in the terminal "npx codeceptjs def --config=web.codecept.conf.js" to refresh web.codecept.conf.js
file structure (notice that web.codecept.conf.js is just an example here and same can be done with api and mobile config files)
