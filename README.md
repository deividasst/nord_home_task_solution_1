# Introduction

This repository contains technical home tasks of:
 - http://ptsv2.com/t/ and https://www.tesonet.com/career/ - automation task (http://ptsv2.com/t/ api is broken)
 - https://api.nordvpn.com/v1/helpers/ips/insights and https://nordcheckout.com/api-pricing


# Installation

1. Install, Node and npm (make sure you are using Long Term Support node version 18.x.x)
   -- find out which node version you have by using 'node -v' command.
2. Run npm install

# Technologies
- For E2E (front-end): CodeceptJS + Playwright(Node.js)
- For Integration (API): CodeceptJS + Axios (Node.js) -> chose instead of Jasmine + Axios because it's easier to set up and execution times are similar.

With CodeceptJS I have ability to write same code base for E2E and integrations tests.

# Executing tests

Run Integration (api) tests [TASK1]:
- npm run test-api-insights
- npm run test-api-insights-multiple (run test in parallel)

Run E2E (front-end) tests [TASK2]:
- npm run test-web (single); 
- npm run test-web-multiple (run test in parallel)
